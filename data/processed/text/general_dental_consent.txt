Since my child is over the age of 13, I also give permission for him/her to present for treatment
unaccompanied by an adult. I understand that no invasive treatment, such as extractions or the
initiation of root canal therapies, will be performed unless I am notified by telephone. In the event
of an emergency, when I cannot be reached, I give permission to perform whatever therapies are
deemed necessary by the treating provider.
(cid:1)
Although my child is over 13, I wish to be present for all treatments performed.
