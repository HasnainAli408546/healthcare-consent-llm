Informed Consent Form for General Dental Procedures
You the patient have the right to accept or reject dental treatment recommended by your dentist. Prior to
consenting to treatment, you should carefully consider the anticipated benefits and commonly known
risks of the recommended procedure, alternative treatments, or the option of no treatment.
Please do not consent to treatment unless and until you discuss potential benefits, risks, and complications
with your dentist and all of your questions are answered. By consenting to treatment, you acknowledge
your willingness to accept known risks and complications, no matter how slight the probability of
occurrence.
It is very important that you provide your dentist with accurate information before, during and after
treatment. It is equally important that you follow your dentist’s advice and recommendations regarding
medication, pre and post treatment instructions, referrals to other dentists or specialists, and return for
scheduled appointments. If you fail to follow the advice of your dentist, you may increase the chances of
a poor outcome.
If you are a woman on oral birth control medication you must consider the fact that antibiotics might
make oral birth control less effective. Please consult with your physician before relying on oral birth
control medication if your dentist prescribes, or if you are taking antibiotics.
1. EXAMINATION AND X-RAYS
I understand that the initial visit may require radiographs in order to complete the examination,
diagnosis, and treatment plan. ___________ Please Initial
2. DRUGS, MEDICATION, AND SEDATION
I have been informed and understand that antibiotic, analgesics, and other medications can cause allergic
reactions causing redness, swelling of tissues, pain, itching, vomiting, and/or anaphylactic shock (severe
allergic reaction). They may cause drowsiness and a lack of awareness and coordination, which can be
increased by the use of alcohol or other drugs. I understand and fully agree not to operate any vehicle or
hazardous device for at least 12 hours or until fully recovered from the effects of the anesthetic
medication and drugs that may have been given me in the office for my treatment. I understand that
failure to take medications prescribed for me in the manner prescribed may offer risks of continued or
aggravated infection, pain, and potential resistance to effect treatment of my condition. I understand that
antibiotics can reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptives. ____________ Please Initial
3. CHANGES IN TREATMENT PLAN
I understand that during treatment, it may be necessary to change or add procedures because found while
working on teeth that were not discovered during the initial examination, the most common being root
canal therapy following routine restorative procedures. I give my permission to the Dentist to make any or
all changes and additions as necessary._________ Please Initial

4. TEMPOROMANDIBULAR JOINT DYSFUNCTIONS (TMJ)
I understand that symptoms of popping, clicking, locking and pain can intensify or develop in the joint of
the lower (near the ear) subsequent to routine dental treatment wherein the mouth is held in the open
position. However, symptoms of TMJ associated with dental treatment are usually temporary in nature
and well tolerated by most patients. I understand that should the need for treatment arise, I will be referred
to a specialist for treatment, the cost of which is my responsibility. ___________ Please Initial
5. FILLINGS AND RESTORATIONS
I understand that care must be exercised in chewing on the new filling during the first 24 hours to avoid
breakage, and tooth sensitivity is a common after-effect of a newly placed filling._________ Please
Initial
6. REMOVAL OF TEETH (EXTRACTION)
An alternative to removal has been explained to me (root canal therapy, crowns, periodontal surgery, etc.)
and I authorize the Dentist to remove the following teeth and any others necessary for the reasons in
paragraph #3. I understand removing teeth does not always remove all infection if present and it may be
necessary to have further treatment. I understand the risks involved in having teeth removed, some of
which are pain, swelling, and spread of infection, dry socket, loss of feeling in my teeth, lips, tongue, and
surrounding tissue (parasthesia) that can last for a period of time or a fractured jaw. I understand I may
need further treatment by a specialist or even hospitalization if complications arise during or following
treatment, the cost of which is my responsibility. _________ Please Initial
7. CROWNS, BRIDGES, VENEERS, AND BONDING
I understand that sometimes it is not possible to match the color of natural teeth exactly with artificial
teeth. I further understand that I may be wearing temporary crowns, which may come off easily and that I
must be careful to ensure that they are kept on until the permanent crowns are delivered. I realized that the
final opportunity to make changes in my new crowns, bridge or veneer (including shape, fit, size,
placement, and color) will be done before cementation. It explained to me that, in very few cases,
cosmetic procedures may result in the need for future root canal treatment, which cannot always be
predicted or anticipated. I understand that cosmetic procedures may affect tooth surfaces and may require
modification of daily cleaning procedures. __________ Please Initial
8. DENTURES – COMPLETE OR PARTIAL
I realize that full or partial dentures are artificial, constructed of plastic, metal and or porcelain.
The potential problems of wearing those appliances have been explained to me, including looseness,
soreness, and possible breakage. I realize the final opportunity to make changes in my new denture
(including shape, fit, size, placement, and color) will be “teeth in wax” try-in visit. I understand that most
dentures require relining approximately three to twelve months after. The cost of this procedure is not the
initial denture fee. __________ Please Initial
9. ENDODONTIC TREATMENT (ROOT CANAL)
I realize there is no guarantee that root canal treatment will save my tooth and those complications can
occur from the treatment and that occasionally posts are cemented in the tooth, or extend through the root,
which does not necessarily affect the success of the treatment. I understand that occasionally additional

--- PAGE 3 ---

surgical procedures may be necessary following root canal treatment (apicoectomy). __________ Please
Initial
10. PERIODONTAL TREATMENT
I understand that I have a serious condition causing gum inflammation and/or bone loss and that it can
lead to the loss of my teeth. Alternative treatment plans have been explained to me, including non-
surgical cleaning, gum surgery and/or extractions. I understand the success of treatment depends in part
on my efforts to brush and floss daily, receive regular cleaning as directed, following a healthy diet, avoid
tobacco products and follow other recommendations. __________ Please Initial
CONSENT: I understand that dentistry is not an exact science, therefore: reputable parishioners cannot
properly guarantee results. I acknowledge that no guarantee or assurance has been made by anyone
regarding the dental treatment which I have requested and authorized. I understand that each Dentist is an
individual practitioner and is individually responsible for the dental care rendered to me. I also understand
that no other Dentist other than the treating Dentist is responsible for my dental treatment.
